        Submarines are tools for which humanity uses to explore the high-pressure depths of the oceans, they require precise calculations and important parts to it so that the crew, the submarine itself an whaterver
        they carry as cargo is safe unless all of these listed will be crushed by the pressure of being that deep underwater such as the "Titanic" sub that was built not up to standard causing the death of 5 people who 
        trusted the people who constructed it. This implosion is a case why the structure of the submarine is important, to explore underwater safely without fear of implosion. The way everything has to  be laid out so
        those that live in the submarines can survive and that it has to be airtight to prevent the submarine from inbalance of mass and prevent from sinking. The history of the submarine spans multiple decades of human 
        history from Leonardo Da Vinci to John Philip Holland, these people contributed to underwater exploration and paved the path to the modernly used submarines in active use to this very day.

        Submarines are feats of engineering, allowing humanity the ability to glimpse into the darkness of our planets oceans. Submarine's are used to explore the deepdepths of Earth's ocean, in order to do this, they 
        need to be designed to withstand the high pressure exerted on the craft, be airtight to prevent the craft to sink permanately and make it so it has the correct buoyancy for submerging and surfacing. The first 
        proper submarine to be designed was in "1578 by a person by the name of William Bourne. He designed the craft to be a wooden frame covered with waterproof leather."(Polmar,2023) This was the start to perfecting 
        the design of the as later on "in 1747 an unidentified man proposed an idea where goat skins were attached to the hull of the craft connected to an aperture at the bottom of the craft, the plan was to fill the 
        goat skin with water to allow the craft to sink and then when wanting to resurface, a tool called the "twisting rod" is used to force the water out of the skin"(Polmar,2023). These first two designs lead the 
        way in the desire to do deeper, to uncover the mysteries our world still keep secret. Submarines are all useful as it allows for the research of unknown, marinebiologist can study species that would otherwise 
        have been impossible to have studied or less scientific  purposes. Submarines can be used for war, as containers for dangerous weapons and placed into places of tatical importance to act as either a detterent 
        or used to combat against hostile ships and hostile submarines. If it can be used in a safe way, they can be used for leisure and can be used to show the life of the depths to tourists or those merely curious.
        Submarines are unique vehicles that allow for the exploration of the depths of the sea. Modern submarines work by filling part of some of the ship with water to allow for the ship to sink, the parts that are 
        filled with water are called "Ballast tanks" and "Trim tanks", The ballast tanks are primarily located at the front, back and centre of the submarine. Ballast tanks were implemented when a man by the name of 
        "David Bushneil of Connecticut" added a manual pump in his submarine named the TURTLE which allows for the water ballast to be ejected from it.(Pohler,1969) This method inspired other designers as afterward, 
        many would use the similar configuration within their submarine with less manual versions. Afterwards, they added on-board air-compressors, these were manually used to recharge high pressure air banks, the 
        earliest recording for when the air-compressor were used for blowing Ballast tanks is credited to a submarine by the name of "Le Plongeur" in 1863. "This ship, designed by Brun and Bourgeois, carried large 
        quantities of air stored at 180 psi, and used compressed air for propulsion"(Pohler,1969)

        In the image above, it shows the layout of "Le Plongeur" This ship was known as the first submarine to be powered by mechanical forces and created by "Arsenal de Rochefort" for the fench army. It was meant 
        to be used as a stealth submarine used to ram into other large vhicles with its tip to cause large holes in its hull. Submarines require precise calculations to calculate how much it requires to submerge and 
        surface as well as keeping enough air in the submarine so those working in said submarine are able to breathe and work to maintain the submarine so it does not have a malfunction and can perform its intended 
        purpose.
