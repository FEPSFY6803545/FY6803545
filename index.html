        Submarines are feats of engineering, allowing humanity the ability to glimpse into the darkness of our planets oceans. Submarine's are used to explore the deep
        depths of Earth's ocean, in order to do this, they need to be designed to withstand the high pressure exerted on the craft and be airtight to prevent the craft
        to sink permanately, and make it so it can submerge and float back up. The first proper submarine to be designed was in "1578 by a person by the name of William
        Bourne. He designed the craft to be a wooden frame covered with waterproof leather."(Polmar,2023) This was the start to perfecting the design of the as later on
        "in 1747 an unidentified man proposed an idea where goat skins were attached to the hull of the craft connected to an aperture at the bottom of the craft, the
        plan was to fill the goat skin with water to allow the craft to sink and then when wanting to resurface, a tool called the "twisting rod" is used to force the 
        water out of the skin"(Polmar,2023). These first two designs lead the way in the desire to do deeper, to uncover the mysteries our world still keep secret.

        Submarines are unique vehicles that allow for the exploration of the depths of the sea. Modern submarines work by filling part of some of the ship with water to allow for the ship to sink, the parts that are filled
        with water are called "Ballast tanks" and "Trim tanks", The ballast tanks are primarily located at the front, back and centre of the submarine. Ballast tanks were implemented when a man by the name of "David Bushneil 
        of Connecticut" added a manual pump in his submarine named the TURTLE which allows for the water ballast to be ejected from it.(POHIER,1969) This method inspired other designers as afterward, many would use the similar 
        configuration within their submarine with less manual versions. Afterwards, they added on-board air-compressors, these were manually used to recharge high pressure air banks, the earliest recording for when the air-compressor
        were used for blowing Ballast tanks is credited to a submarine by the name of "LE PLONGEUR" in 1863. "This ship, designed by Brun and Bourgeois, carried large quantities of air stored at 180 psi, and used compressed air for propulsion"
        (POHIER,1969)
